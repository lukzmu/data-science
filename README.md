Hey there! This is my repository for anything related to **Data Science**. Nothing fancy, just checking out various courses, competitions and mini-projects. Maybe you will find this helpful. Enjoy!

Over time this repo grew a bit, so for your convenience here are links to sections:

- [DataCamp](#datacamp)
- [Kaggle](#kaggle)
- [Projects](#projects)
