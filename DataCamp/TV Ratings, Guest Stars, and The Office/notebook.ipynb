Welcome!\n<p><img src=\"https://assets.datacamp.com/production/project_1170/img/office_cast.jpeg\" alt=\"Markdown\">.</p>\n<p><strong>The Office!</strong> What started as a British mockumentary series about office culture in 2001 has since spawned ten other variants across the world, including an Israeli version (2010-13), a Hindi version (2019-), and even a French Canadian variant (2006-2007). Of all these iterations (including the original), the American series has been the longest-running, spanning 201 episodes over nine seasons.</p>\n<p>In this notebook, we will take a look at a dataset of The Office episodes, and try to understand how the popularity and quality of the series varied over time. To do so, we will use the following dataset: <code>datasets/office_episodes.csv</code>, which was downloaded from Kaggle <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/nehaprabhavalkar/the-office-dataset\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>This dataset contains information on a variety of characteristics of each episode. In detail, these are:\n<br></p>\n<div style=\"background-color: #efebe4; color: #05192d; text-align:left; vertical-align: middle; padding: 15px 25px 15px 25px; line-height: 1.6;\">\n    <div style=\"font-size:20px\"><b>datasets/office_episodes.csv</b></div>\n<ul>\n    <li><b>episode_number:</b> Canonical episode number.</li>\n    <li><b>season:</b> Season in which the episode appeared.</li>\n    <li><b>episode_title:</b> Title of the episode.</li>\n    <li><b>description:</b> Description of the episode.</li>\n    <li><b>ratings:</b> Average IMDB rating.</li>\n    <li><b>votes:</b> Number of votes.</li>\n    <li><b>viewership_mil:</b> Number of US viewers in millions.</li>\n    <li><b>duration:</b> Duration in number of minutes.</li>\n    <li><b>release_date:</b> Airdate.</li>\n    <li><b>guest_stars:</b> Guest stars in the episode (if any).</li>\n    <li><b>director:</b> Director of the episode.</li>\n    <li><b>writers:</b> Writers of the episode.</li>\n    <li><b>has_guests:</b> True/False column for whether the episode contained guest stars.</li>\n    <li><b>scaled_ratings:</b> The ratings scaled from 0 (worst-reviewed) to 1 (best-reviewed).</li>\n</ul>\n    </div>"},{"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"4"}},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Tasks\n\n1. Create a matplotlib scatter plot of the data that contains the following attributes:\n\n- Each episode's episode number plotted along the x-axis\n- Each episode's viewership (in millions) plotted along the y-axis\n- A color scheme reflecting the scaled ratings (not the regular ratings) of each episode, such that:\n   - Ratings < 0.25 are colored \"red\"\n   - Ratings >= 0.25 and < 0.50 are colored \"orange\"\n   - Ratings >= 0.50 and < 0.75 are colored \"lightgreen\"\n   - Ratings >= 0.75 are colored \"darkgreen\"\n- A sizing system, such that episodes with guest appearances have a marker size of 250 and episodes without are sized 25\n- A title, reading \"Popularity, Quality, and Guest Appearances on the Office\"\n- An x-axis label reading \"Episode Number\"\n- A y-axis label reading \"Viewership (Millions)\"\n2. Provide the name of one of the guest stars (hint, there were multiple!) who was in the most watched Office episode. Save it as a string in the variable top_star (e.g. top_star = \"Will Ferrell\").\n\n#### Bonus step\n\nAlthough it was not taught in Intermediate Python, a useful skill for visualizing different data points is to use a different marker. You can learn more about them via the Matplotlib documentation or via our course Introduction to Data Visualization with Matplotlib. Thus, as a bonus step, try to differentiate guest appearances not just with size, but also with a star!"},{"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"4"},"trusted":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Impor\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt","execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"4"},"tags":["sample_code"],"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data = pd.read_csv(\"datasets/office_episodes.csv\")\ndata.head()","execution_count":9,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","execution_count":9,"data":{"text/plain":"   episode_number  season  episode_title  \\\n0               0       1          Pilot   \n1               1       1  Diversity Day   \n2               2       1    Health Care   \n3               3       1   The Alliance   \n4               4       1     Basketball   \n\n                                         description  ratings  votes  \\\n0  The premiere episode introduces the boss and s...      7.5   4936   \n1  Michael's off color remark puts a sensitivity ...      8.3   4801   \n2  Michael leaves Dwight in charge of picking the...      7.8   4024   \n3  Just for a laugh, Jim agrees to an alliance wi...      8.1   3915   \n4  Michael and his staff challenge the warehouse ...      8.4   4294   \n\n   viewership_mil  duration release_date guest_stars         director  \\\n0            11.2        23   2005-03-24         NaN       Ken Kwapis   \n1             6.0        23   2005-03-29         NaN       Ken Kwapis   \n2             5.8        22   2005-04-05         NaN  Ken Whittingham   \n3             5.4        23   2005-04-12         NaN     Bryan Gordon   \n4             5.0        23   2005-04-19         NaN     Greg Daniels   \n\n                                            writers  has_guests  \\\n0  Ricky Gervais |Stephen Merchant and Greg Daniels       False   \n1                                       B.
